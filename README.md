# OneList.fm

##What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
OneList was created with the philosophy that anyone should be able to enjoy all their music everywhere. Instead of having some of your favorite music saved in a playlist in Spotify, some in an Rdio playlist, and so on.

OneList uses a text file containing a list of the user's favorite songs and artists and presents the user with a list of streaming platforms the user can choose to use. This way, a user doesn't have to settle with created a favorite list in Rdio and manually create another one in Spotify, of course also updating each list manually. OneList fixes thatâ€”having a single list of your favorite music everywhere solves this problem.

While this version only supports a text file, the future applications, once implemented, are endless: the user could select a file from Dropbox, Simplenote, or Evernote, so that their favorite music are truly everywhere.

##Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Walter Ceder (webapp genius), StackOverflow (every error possible), JoshMorony.com (his Spotify login code)

##Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
20

##Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
Not specific to all students, but they might need to learn how OAuth works to get Spotify login to work and store token. This took a really long time for me.
