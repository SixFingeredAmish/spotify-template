# Soundwaves

##What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
Soundwaves was created with the philosophy that music at its very core is just soundwaves. Soundwaves are everywhere and they are platform agnostic—why shouldn't music be the same?

Soundwaves allows users to upload a text file containing a list of their favorite songs and artists and presents the user with a list of streaming platforms the user can choose to use. This way, a user doesn't have to settle with created a favorite list in Rdio and manually create another one in Spotify, of course also updating each list manually. Soundwaves fixes that—having one list everywhere solves this problem.

While this version only supports a text file, the future applications, once implemented, are endless: the user could select a file from Dropbox, Simplenote, or Evernote, so that their favorite music are truly everywhere.
